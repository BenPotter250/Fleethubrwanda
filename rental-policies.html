    <h2>11. Vehicle Inspection and Condition Agreement</h2>
    <h3>11.1 Pre- and Post-Rental Inspection</h3>
    <p>
      Prior to vehicle handover and again upon its return, both the Customer and the Rental Company are required to complete a Vehicle Inspection Form, capturing and uploading date- and time-stamped photos or videos of the vehicle's exterior and interior via the Fleethub platform. These serve as the official record of the vehicle's condition.
    </p>
    <h3>11.2 Digital Checklist and Acknowledgment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual condition of the vehicle</li>
      <li>Mileage and fuel level</li>
      <li>Presence of accessories (e.g., GPS, spare tire, baby seat)</li>
      <li>Noted damage, if any</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both the Customer and Rental Company must digitally acknowledge and sign the checklist at each stage.</p>
    <h3>11.3 Dispute Resolution via Fleethub</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of any disagreement related to the vehicle’s condition, Fleethub may act as a neutral facilitator. Fleethub will review submitted inspection forms, media evidence, and timestamps to issue a non-binding recommendation. Should the parties fail to reach a resolution, the matter may be escalated to legal or insurance channels in accordance with Rwandan law.
    </p>
    <h3>11.4 Penalty for Failure to Complete Inspection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Customer being liable for any unreported damage not documented at pickup.</li>
      <li>The Rental Company forfeiting the right to claim for damages not documented at drop-off.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>11.5 After-Hours / Solo Vehicle Return Protocol</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Customer is required to upload full photographic documentation of the vehicle’s condition at the time of drop-off via Fleethub.</li>
      <li>The Rental Company must conduct a return inspection within 12 hours of the vehicle being dropped off and upload corresponding evidence.</li>
      <li>Fleethub will compare both submissions if a dispute arises.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>11.6 Obligation to Cooperate</h3>
    <p>
      Both parties agree to provide complete, accurate, and timely evidence in the event of an inspection-related claim. Refusal to cooperate may negatively affect dispute resolution outcomes.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>12. Fuel Policy</h2>
    <h3>12.1 Fuel Level Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      At both the beginning and end of the rental period, the Rental Company is required to document the vehicle’s fuel level on the Vehicle Inspection Form, with confirmation by the Customer. This should be supported by a clear, date-stamped photo of the dashboard, showing the fuel gauge at the time of pickup and drop-off.
    </p>
    <h3>12.2 Accepted Fuel Evidence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fuel readings submitted on the digital inspection form, and</li>
      <li>Photo evidence showing the dashboard fuel gauge, which must be uploaded within 1 hour of pickup or return.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>12.3 Standardized Fuel Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full-to-Full:</strong> The vehicle is provided with a full tank and must be returned full. Failure to refill will result in a fuel surcharge based on local fuel rates plus a service fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Same-as-Pickup:</strong> The vehicle should be returned with the same level of fuel as documented at pickup. Any shortfall will be charged accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>12.4 Fuel Charges and Disputes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Rental Company must provide supporting inspection records and photo evidence.</li>
      <li>The Customer may dispute such charges through Fleethub within 48 hours of being notified.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>12.5 No Refund for Excess Fuel</h3>
    <p>
      If a vehicle is returned with more fuel than at pickup, no refund or credit will be issued unless explicitly stated in the Rental Company’s listing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <hr />

  <section>
    <h2>13. Vehicle Type and Substitution Policy</h2>
    <h3>13.1 “Or Similar” Vehicle Listings</h3>
    <p>
      Vehicles listed on Fleethub may be described using the format “[Model] or similar” (e.g., Toyota RAV4 or similar). This means the Customer may receive a different make or model within the same category, offering similar size, specifications, transmission type, and luggage/passenger capacity.
    </p>
    <h3>13.2 Advance Notification of Substitution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inform both Fleethub and the Customer in advance of the proposed substitution, and</li>
      <li>Ensure that the replacement vehicle meets the same class, fuel type, transmission, and passenger capacity as the originally booked vehicle.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>13.3 Customer Rights in Case of Downgrade</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Customer may be entitled to a partial refund, based on the pricing difference between the booked and delivered category.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, Fleethub may offer a complimentary upgrade or discount on a future booking, subject to approval.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>13.4 Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      Any dispute regarding vehicle substitution or category mismatch may be submitted to Fleethub for review. Fleethub will assess evidence including booking details, photos, and communication history to facilitate a fair resolution.

      The Customer is solely responsible for all traffic violations, parking tickets, toll fees, and other road-related fines incurred during the rental period.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Rental Company must upload official proof of the infraction to Fleethub’s platform or provide it via email.</li>
      <li>This proof must include ticket or citation number, vehicle plate number, date, time, and location of the violation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>14.3 Post-Rental Charges</h3>
    <p>
      Traffic fines and toll charges may be billed to the Customer’s registered payment method even after the rental period has ended.
    </p>
    <h3>14.4 Administrative Fees</h3>
    <p>
      Rental Companies may charge a reasonable administrative fee to cover the handling of such fines, provided this fee is clearly disclosed in the Rental Company’s listing prior to booking.
    </p>
    <h3>14.5 Dispute Process</h3>
    <p>
      If the Customer wishes to dispute a charge related to a fine, they must notify Fleethub within 7 days of receiving the charge, providing any relevant counter-evidence. Fleethub will review the submitted documentation and may mediate, but final liability lies with the violator.

    <h2>15. Security Deposit and Refund Policy</h2>
    <h3>15.1 Deposit Requirement</h3>

    </p>
    <h3>15.2 Refund Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      The security deposit will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days from vehicle return and inspection, to the original payment method.
    </p>
    <h3>15.3 Status Notifications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirmation of deposit hold at pickup,</li>
